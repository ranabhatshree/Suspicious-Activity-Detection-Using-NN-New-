![suspicious thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranabhatshree/Suspicious-Activity-Detection-Using-NN-New-/main/suspecious_activity.jpg)

An Intelligent surveillance system that can monitor the human activities from videos and categorize them as usual and unusual activities.
System will identify the type of activities (Fighting, Explosion, Burglary, Normal, etc.) If it is suspicious then it predicts with the respective classes.

## Objectives
- To compare suspicious activities in the different neural network architecture.
- To predict the suspicious class e.g: Fighting, Normal etc. from the videos.
